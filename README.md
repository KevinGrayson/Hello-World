# Hello-World
The first official repository I've made.
It has taken me nearly five years to get to this point. I will not point the blame at anyone but myself, as I have had no control over the actions of those who have altered my life path.  What I can say, however, is this: I am changed, for better and worse, and it is time I set foot down the path I dreamed of all those years ago.
